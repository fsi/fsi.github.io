      <description>Galactic Center Saga Still have to read these.
The Galactic Center Saga is a series of books by author Gregory Benford detailing a galactic war between mechanical and biological life.
Personal notes Found about it in a post on scifi stackexchange post (OP asked to identify a book they&amp;rsquo;ve read in the early 1990s). The synopsis, as described by OP, made me interested in the whole series.
 Read this sometime in late 1980s / early 1990s.</description>

      <description>The Herring Gull&amp;rsquo;s World (This is a review of &amp;ldquo;The Herring Gull&amp;rsquo;s World: A Study Of The Social Behaviour Of Birds&amp;rdquo; by Nikolaas Tinbergen)
Picked this book from a discout shelf on an impulse. Was not disappointed in the least.
It&amp;rsquo;s always interesting to read the reports made by people captivated by the thing they&amp;rsquo;re reporting about, and Mr Tinbergen is clearly captivated by animals and the intricacies of their behavior.</description>
