      <description> plug-n-pwn  Unfortunately Intel has placed large amounts of information about the Thunderbolt controllers and protocol under NDA, meaning that it has not been properly researched leading to a string of vulnerabilities over the years.

      <description>First off, hackernews brought me a link to awfice - a suite of minimal (read: one-liner data-url minimal) &amp;ldquo;office&amp;rdquo; tools. Text editor, presentations, quick drawing thingie and a spreadsheet (the spreadsheet being the most sketchy of four). Also on github. From there, I was clicking around sent ‚Äî another minimal presentations tool, this time from suckless.org. I mostly know them for their dwm window manager, which is so small you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to recompile it to change the config.</description>

      <description>This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to do for a long time (11 months? omg), but here it is at last. This site/blog is now powered by Hugo. I tried to keep stuff similar to how it was before, while adding my own flair.
The feed URL has been changed. I guess you know that if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, but make sure to update your RSS reader otherwise.
Also, as the sources for this site is now in plain markdown, I&amp;rsquo;ve merged them with my (previously private) notes, so now you can enjoy such masterpieces as my meat marinades and add-srt-to-mp4.</description>

      <description>Meat marinades For lamb  Peel and chop the garlic into fine pieces. Mix the garlic, rosemary, olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a shallow baking dish or another nonreactive dish. This marinade will penetrate the steaks for a tender result. Yogurt mint marinade: mix 1/2 cup whole milk yogurt, 2 cloves minced garlic, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1/4 cup chopped mint, and salt and pepper to taste.</description>

      <description>Galactic Center Saga Still have to read these.
The Galactic Center Saga is a series of books by author Gregory Benford detailing a galactic war between mechanical and biological life.
Personal notes Found about it in a post on scifi stackexchange post (OP asked to identify a book they&amp;rsquo;ve read in the early 1990s). The synopsis, as described by OP, made me interested in the whole series.
 Read this sometime in late 1980s / early 1990s.</description>

      <description>How to add subtitle track to an mp4 file This is hard to keep in memory, and the source page might get deleted (and ffmpeg&amp;rsquo;s cli is unlikely to change).
Code:
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i sub.srt -c:v copy -c:a copy -c:s mov_text -metadata:s:s:0 language=eng output.mp4 mp4 container works fine with .srt subtitles, with other formats remuxing to mkv might be necessary.

      <description>Programming   Laser-Based Audio Injection on Voice-Controllable Systems
TL;DR:
 By shining the laser through the window at microphones inside smart speakers, tablets, or phones, a far away attacker can remotely send inaudible and potentially invisible commands which are then acted upon by Alexa, Portal, Google assistant or Siri.

      <description>Shorter one this time, for I was attending Moscow Music Week.
It&amp;rsquo;s a festival here in Moscow, with quite a few places and performances (that, sadly, happen all at the same time) for four days straight.
Due to the aforementioned happening-at-the-same-time, I was only able to attend a couple of the showcases, namely Free Jazz and Dark Jazz ones. Quite liked these (even though the Dark Jazz showcase there were three free jazz performances and only one dark-jazz one).</description>

Brutal Assault (August 7 to August 11) Brutal Assault is a yearly heavy metal festival held in fortress Josefov, near Jaromerz in Czech Republic.
It is held in an old fortress that has seen WWII, WWI and many wars before that, presumably (being medieval and all that).</description>

  A better zip bomb; NON-RECURSIVE zip-bombs that extract from 42 kB to 5.5 GB, from 10MB to 281TB, or from 46MB to 4.5PB (last one is Zip64 and not as compatible). Non-recursive means you get that amount of date in a single extract operation.
Not quite useful information, but interesting nonetheless.

TL;DR: (probably) yes
I myself quite liked the proof-of-work captcha concept (i.e. &amp;ldquo;mine some hashes for me if you want to comment; if you want to spam a lot, it&amp;rsquo;s ok, just mine a lot of hashes&amp;rdquo;)</description>

      <description>Programming   Sorting in Japanese is hard
 There are four Japanese women whose names you have to sort: Junko, Atsuko, Kiyoko, and Akiko. This does not seem difficult, until they each show you how they write their names in kanji:
   Ê∑≥Â≠ê (Junko) Ê∑≥Â≠ê (Atsuko) Ê∑≥Â≠ê (Kiyoko) Ê∑≥Â≠ê (Akiko)     AMP for email is a terrible idea
TL;DR: yes.

      <description>Programming   C is Not a Low-level Language
All programming languages are abstractions, in some way. Even simplistic ones, like C and x86 assembly, are now quite far from the bare bones of the hardware (at least, in the x86-world) &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s just too many layers of intermediate translations and optimizations that the CPU does by itself.
RISC architectures are better in that regard, as even x86 CPUs are RISC-like internally nowadays (or so they say), so at least it&amp;rsquo;s more transparent that way.</description>

      <description>In this post, I will try and gather some interesting stuff I found around the internets.
  Event sourcing is hard. I used to work on an large product which was based on event-sourcing, and can agree on many points made by the author. It was very fun, but also a lot of pain.
I guess, eventually, when the right tooling will be sourced, it will be usable&amp;hellip; (Apache Kafka/Zamza come to mind; then again, it were these exact things that made us consider event-sourcing in the first place)</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to my personal space, where I will probably post random links for, like, two people to notice.
I made it using gatsby.js, and the experience was OK. In retrospect I think I should&amp;rsquo;ve used some better starter, and not try and bend the default one to my will. Oh well.
This whole thing seems to be working, so yay.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of things that I still have to do at some point:</description>

      <description>The Herring Gull&amp;rsquo;s World (This is a review of &amp;ldquo;The Herring Gull&amp;rsquo;s World: A Study Of The Social Behaviour Of Birds&amp;rdquo; by Nikolaas Tinbergen)
Picked this book from a discout shelf on an impulse. Was not disappointed in the least.
It&amp;rsquo;s always interesting to read the reports made by people captivated by the thing they&amp;rsquo;re reporting about, and Mr Tinbergen is clearly captivated by animals and the intricacies of their behavior.</description>
