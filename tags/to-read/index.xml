      <description>Galactic Center Saga Still have to read these.
The Galactic Center Saga is a series of books by author Gregory Benford detailing a galactic war between mechanical and biological life.
Personal notes Found about it in a post on scifi stackexchange post (OP asked to identify a book they&amp;rsquo;ve read in the early 1990s). The synopsis, as described by OP, made me interested in the whole series.
 Read this sometime in late 1980s / early 1990s.</description>
