      <description>Toshiba Libretto 50CT It&amp;rsquo;s an old (1997) laptop. It has Pentium-75 and 16MB of RAM. Its screen is 640x480 pixels big (sans a couple of dead ones). Mine lacks the port replicator, so the only connections I have are IR, PC Card and speaker ports. No floppy/CD drive either.
My plans for it My plans on it depend on how broken it actually is, but I&amp;rsquo;m torn between a retro-gaming machine and a tiny off-the-grid workstation.</description>

      <description>«Smart» speaker project Provisional name: &amp;ldquo;hobos&amp;rdquo;
Basic idea: dumb speaker + basic single-board pc (e.g. Pi Zero W) + linux with mpd ⇒ profit
Hardware Done:
 Very cheap USB powered speaker in &amp;ldquo;soundbar&amp;rdquo; form-factor (about $15) OrangePi Lite Some cheapo 8GB SD card Cheapo USB sound card (OrangePi lite has a line-out but the pads are microscopic) USB hub (to power both OrangePi and speaker)  Todo:
 Heatsinks for the board (it gets really hot unless you throttle the CPU on every boot) * Check if my USB power supply is enough to power both board and the speaker :| * Put everything inside the speaker case (after some checking, it should all fit fine) ****  Software So far (2020-10-15), I have only flashed linux on it :|</description>
