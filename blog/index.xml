      <description>Haven&amp;rsquo;t posted in a while, so here&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of stuff all at once!
Received a letter (thanks F.), sent a letter (hopefully it arrives!). I like sending mail, maybe I should reactivate my postcrossing account (is postcrossing still a thing?).
Random links! (BTW, you can follow my random links posts at the main RSS here)

      <description> plug-n-pwn  Unfortunately Intel has placed large amounts of information about the Thunderbolt controllers and protocol under NDA, meaning that it has not been properly researched leading to a string of vulnerabilities over the years.

      <description>This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to do for a long time (11 months? omg), but here it is at last. This site/blog is now powered by Hugo. I tried to keep stuff similar to how it was before, while adding my own flair.
The feed URL has been changed. I guess you know that if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, but make sure to update your RSS reader otherwise.
Also, as the sources for this site is now in plain markdown, I&amp;rsquo;ve merged them with my (previously private) notes, so now you can enjoy such masterpieces as my meat marinades and add-srt-to-mp4.</description>

TL;DR:
 By shining the laser through the window at microphones inside smart speakers, tablets, or phones, a far away attacker can remotely send inaudible and potentially invisible commands which are then acted upon by Alexa, Portal, Google assistant or Siri.

TL;DR: Someone is making an 8-bit OS just in case to be useful in post-collapse scenarios.
 With a copy of this project, a capable and creative person should be able to manage to build and install Collapse OS without external resources (i.e. internet) on a machine of her design, built from scavenged parts with low-tech tools.

      <description>Shorter one this time, for I was attending Moscow Music Week.
It&amp;rsquo;s a festival here in Moscow, with quite a few places and performances (that, sadly, happen all at the same time) for four days straight.
Due to the aforementioned happening-at-the-same-time, I was only able to attend a couple of the showcases, namely Free Jazz and Dark Jazz ones. Quite liked these (even though the Dark Jazz showcase there were three free jazz performances and only one dark-jazz one).</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief log of my travels to make up for all the missed posts (as I, in fact, pledged to post once a week or so).
Brutal Assault (August 7 to August 11) Brutal Assault is a yearly heavy metal festival held in fortress Josefov, near Jaromerz in Czech Republic.
It is held in an old fortress that has seen WWII, WWI and many wars before that, presumably (being medieval and all that).</description>

  Why are the prices so damn high?
Mostly linking it for this tangent that almost hurts to read:

(direct link)
  A better zip bomb; NON-RECURSIVE zip-bombs that extract from 42 kB to 5.5 GB, from 10MB to 281TB, or from 46MB to 4.5PB (last one is Zip64 and not as compatible). Non-recursive means you get that amount of date in a single extract operation.
Not quite useful information, but interesting nonetheless.

 There are four Japanese women whose names you have to sort: Junko, Atsuko, Kiyoko, and Akiko. This does not seem difficult, until they each show you how they write their names in kanji:

      <description>Programming   C is Not a Low-level Language
All programming languages are abstractions, in some way. Even simplistic ones, like C and x86 assembly, are now quite far from the bare bones of the hardware (at least, in the x86-world) &amp;ndash; there&amp;rsquo;s just too many layers of intermediate translations and optimizations that the CPU does by itself.
RISC architectures are better in that regard, as even x86 CPUs are RISC-like internally nowadays (or so they say), so at least it&amp;rsquo;s more transparent that way.</description>
