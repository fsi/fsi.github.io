  <p>In this post, I will try and gather some interesting stuff I found around the internets.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://chriskiehl.com/article/event-sourcing-is-hard">Event sourcing is hard</a>.
I used to work on an large product which was based on event-sourcing, and can agree on many points made by the author.
It was very fun, but also a lot of pain.</p>
<p>I guess, <em>eventually</em>, when the right tooling will be <em>sourced</em>, it will be usable&hellip;
(Apache Kafka/Zamza come to mind; then again, it were these exact things that made us consider event-sourcing in the first place)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.rarenoiserecords.com/anguish">Anguish</a> from rare noise records, an experimental mix of hip-hop and dark jazz improvisations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prefect-Revelation-Space-Book-ebook/dp/B0015DYJY4/">The Prefect</a> by Alastair Reynolds.
Also a mix, but of hard sci-fi and murder mystery.
Technically this book is in the same universe as his Revelation Space trilogy, but it&rsquo;s quite separate and reading other books is not required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-history-of-tinyplanet-and-panoramas">The Long History of the Mind-Bending ‚ÄòTiny Planet‚Äô Panorama</a>, from Atlas Obscura</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The only non-post update to this site is I&rsquo;ve changed the &ldquo;background&rdquo; color in its manifest to my &ldquo;brand&rdquo; color, that is, <code>#da5f51</code>.</p>
